# Leveraging-KL-Divergence-Loss-for-Enhanced-Machine-Learning-Performance


Kullback-Leibler divergence class or relative entropy is an exceptional instance of a more
extensive divergence. It is an estimation of how a particular dissemination wanders from
another, normal likelihood appropriation.This report seeks to gain an intuitive understanding of KL divergence, an important concept in machine learning and statistics. This
report provides a comprehensive yet accessible introduction to KL divergence, also known
as relative entropy. Key aspects covered include the definition and mathematical properties of KL divergence, visualizations illustrating asymmetric behavior, code examples
demonstrating calculation, and discussion of common applications such as comparing
distributions and evaluating generative models
